    name: 'Foundation Exercises for Pitchers',
    instructions: `Foundation exercises for Fastpitch softball pitchers. 

1. Single Leg Raises:  Builds quad strength to help with pushing off the mound and creating resistance on the landing leg. 

Perform 3 sets of 10 on each leg. Add ankle weights for added resistance 

2. Hip Flexor Stretch: POWER COMES FROM THE HIPS! Having tight muscles can limit the range of motion and limit power production.

3. Glute Bridges: Push through the heels to fire backside muscles. This is a great way to learn to fire these muscles and build basic strength. 

4. Glute circuit: Hip circles (think about arm circles) improves range of motion in the hip joint, Reverse leg lifts tightens the backside, side lifts works the outside (hard to strengthen) of the hip, then donkey kicks to really isolate the glute (big muscle you sit on). 

*All exercises can be done with ankle weights.*

5. 90 Second Plank - Works core in all directions. Focus on keeping your hips level with the floor throughout the planks.
